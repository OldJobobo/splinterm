title: Installation
description: Install or update Splinterm on Arch Linux and Omarchy.
---

The validated installation target is **x86_64 Omarchy/Arch Linux with native Wayland under Hyprland**. **0.1.0 is the first stable release**; newer release candidates are prereleases. Stable 0.1.0 does not promise broader platform compatibility or a support lifetime. Future 0.x releases may change interfaces with documented migration. Stopping or replacing the daemon ends its child processes; save your work and upgrade from a terminal not owned by `splinterd`.

## Install the prebuilt AUR package

**AUR is prerelease-capable, not stable-only.** The same package names can advance
to release candidates and offer them as upgrades over stable 0.1.0. Check the
version before confirming installation or upgrades. For stable 0.1.0 specifically,
use its verified release assets or the packaging guide's exact-tag build:

https://github.com/OldJobobo/splinterm/blob/main/docs/packaging.md

Install the recommended [splinterm-bin AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/splinterm-bin). It downloads verified prebuilt x86_64 binaries and resolves the `xdg-terminal-exec` AUR dependency without compiling Splinterm locally:

```bash
yay -S splinterm-bin
```

The optional policy-scoped MCP adapter is a separate exact-version prebuilt package:

```bash
yay -S splinterm-mcp-bin
```

Source-built `splinterm` and `splinterm-mcp` packages remain available. Migrating from them prompts once to approve replacement by the conflicting `-bin` packages. `paru` may be used instead of `yay`. AUR availability does not expand the supported target or promise a support lifetime. Check the package version offered by your helper before confirming an upgrade.

## Install the current versioned release directly

Run either installer mode from Foot or another terminal not owned by `splinterd`.
The installer refuses a Splinterm-owned shell because stopping the daemon would
terminate the installer too. Save active work before upgrading.

For the newest published versioned package, clone the public repository and run the release installer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OldJobobo/splinterm.git
cd splinterm
./install.sh
```

The installer selects the newest published qualifying SemVer `v…` release, **including prereleases**; it is not a stable-only selector. For stable 0.1.0 specifically, use its release assets or the exact-tag build instructions in the packaging guide:

https://github.com/OldJobobo/splinterm/blob/main/docs/packaging.md

The installer verifies the GitHub-recorded candidate-manifest digest and exact package checksums, preserves an emergency binary snapshot, warns before stopping a running daemon, installs through Pacman, and verifies the packaged client identity. The snapshot supports diagnosis and manual recovery; it is not a package-consistent rollback.

The repository and versioned release assets are public. GitHub CLI authentication is optional; the installer falls back to anonymous verified downloads.

:::caution
The default installer downloads only a published versioned release; it never selects historical `edge-*` releases or an arbitrary `main` commit. Source mode operates on a clean committed `HEAD` and does not package uncommitted worktree changes. A development checkout is not the published stable release; use the exact `v0.1.0` tag when building stable 0.1.0. Review the current worktree before using source mode.
:::

## Build from committed source

From the same external terminal, compile and package the current committed checkout locally:

```bash
./install.sh --source
```

Include the complete package test suite with:

```bash
./install.sh --source --check
```

## What installation does not change

The installer does not:

- make Splinterm your default terminal;
- edit Omarchy or Hyprland configuration;
- enable persistent systemd user lingering; or
- opt a fresh installation into the optional MCP package.

To opt into the reversible Omarchy default-terminal, terminal-tag, and screensaver setup after installation:

```bash
splinterm integration omarchy enable
splinterm integration omarchy status
```

Use `splinterm integration omarchy disable` to remove its managed changes. This
is optional; the installed desktop entry works without it.

Continue to the [quickstart](/docs/quickstart/) after installation. If an MCP host needs bounded access, follow the separate [MCP adapter setup](/docs/mcp/); installing the adapter alone grants no authority.
