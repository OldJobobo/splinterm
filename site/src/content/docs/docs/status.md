title: Current status
description: What is implemented, validated, limited, planned, and unreleased in Splinterm.
---

Splinterm is an **advanced private prerelease**. Substantial core behavior is implemented and validated, while public distribution, compatibility guarantees, and a support policy remain unreleased.

## What that means

- The product runs and has a normal graphical daily-use path.
- Core terminal, persistence, multiplexing, packaging, and automation milestones have recorded validation.
- The current target is narrow: x86_64 Omarchy/Arch Linux with native Wayland.
- Installation currently uses private prerelease packages or a committed source checkout.
- Broader distribution and long-term compatibility promises have not been released.

## Capability summary

| Area | Current state |
| --- | --- |

| Multi-client controller transfer | Implemented and validated |
| JSON/NDJSON automation | Implemented and validated |
| SSH stdio relay | Implemented and validated |
| [MCP adapter](/docs/mcp/) | Implemented and validated as an optional, separately policy-identified package |
| Sixel, practical Kitty static images, inline iTerm2 PNG | Documented supported subsets |
| Arch/Omarchy package | Private prerelease package validated |
| Public distribution | Not released |
| Nix and broader distributions | Planned |

## Important boundaries

Splinterm is **security-conscious**, not absolutely secure. [Automation](/docs/automation/) is constrained by executable identity, explicit scopes, resource limits, controller ownership, revocation, and bounded audit metadata. Terminal output is always untrusted data and cannot grant authority.

Persistent topology is also separate from graphical presentation. Creating or mutating a Dojo does not map, focus, move, or resize a native Wayland window. Read [Why native Wayland?](/docs/wayland/) for the direct-compositor benefits, comparison model, and explicit non-claims.

## Before depending on it

Review the repository roadmap and the exact specialist documentation for the feature you intend to use. This local site is an initial reorganization, not a new compatibility guarantee.
